The DateTimeField of Models has the auto_now_add and auto_now. The former save
the date the object is add as default. While the latter save the "now" date
every time the object is updated.

    created = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)


When defining a custom manager, "objects" has to be re-initiated with the default
models.Manager(), if not define django uses the custom manager as the default Manager
for the Model.

    objects = models.Manager()
    custom = CustomManager()
